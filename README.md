When the user runs the application, they will see a homepage. The navigation bar contains a single tab labeled "Home," which takes the user back to the starting page. The first step is for the user to create an employee by clicking the designated button. After clicking it, a form will appear. The user must fill out the form by providing employee details such as first name, last name, description, position, and an optional task.

The user can also create a task by clicking the button on the homepage. After clicking, they must fill out the form by adding a title, description, and status.

Once an employee is added, the user will see a list of employees displayed on the homepage. By clicking on a specific employee, the user can add new tasks and update existing tasks.

   `python manage.py createsuperuser`
